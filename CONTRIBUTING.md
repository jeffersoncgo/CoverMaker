# Contributing to CoverMaker

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Contributions help improve the project and grow the community. This document explains how to submit issues, share exported projects, and propose code changes.

1. Reporting issues
   - Before opening an issue, search existing issues to avoid duplicates.
   - Provide a clear title and a concise description of the problem.
   - Include steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior, browser and version, and any relevant logs or screenshots.

2. Sharing your project files (community gallery)
   - To share a sample composite for the gallery, export your project from the app as a `.project.zip` (Export project).
   - Attach the `.project.zip` to a new issue or include a link to a downloadable location.
   - Optionally include the final exported image and an app screenshot to help reviewers.

3. Submitting code changes (PRs)
   - Fork the repository and create a topic branch for your change.
   - Keep changes focused and include tests or a short demo where possible.
   - Update documentation when you add features or change behavior.
   - Open a Pull Request describing the change, why it is needed, and any migration steps.

4. Style and guidelines
   - JavaScript: modern ES6+ syntax is preferred. Keep modules small and focused.
   - Avoid reintroducing deprecated legacy code; prefer modular patterns and registries.
   - Ensure accessibility where applicable (alt text, keyboard navigation for UI controls).

5. License and attribution
   - By contributing, you agree to license your contributions under the repository MIT license.

Thank you — we look forward to your contributions! If you want help preparing your `.project.zip` for submission, open an issue and we'll guide you.
