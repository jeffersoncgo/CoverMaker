# 📘 Contributing to CoverMaker

Thanks for your interest in helping improve **CoverMaker**!
Contributions of all types—bug reports, ideas, code, or shared project files—are welcome.

Below is a lightweight guide to how you can participate.
Everything is optional; follow whichever path fits your contribution.

## 1. Reporting Issues

If you’ve found a problem or unexpected behavior:

* Check existing issues first to avoid duplicates.
* Use a clear, descriptive title.
* Include:

  * Steps to reproduce
  * What you expected vs. what happened
  * Browser + version
  * Any screenshots, logs, or exported results that help illustrate the issue

Concise, reproducible reports help tremendously.

## 2. Sharing Your Project Files

*(Community Gallery & Future Presets)*

If you want to showcase a design or help expand the upcoming preset library:

* Export your project from the app as a **`.zip`**.
* Attach the file directly to an issue or include a download link.
* (Optional) Add:

  * The final rendered image
  * A screenshot of the editor layout
  * A short description of the idea or technique used

> Note:
> The **`.zip`** is **not** a development or source file—it's just the app’s export format.

You only need to provide it when contributing to the **gallery** or **future preset collections**.

1. Fork the repository and create a feature/topic branch.
2. Keep changes focused; avoid large, unrelated bundles.
3. Include small demos or tests if relevant.
4. Update documentation when behaviors or parameters change.
5. Open a Pull Request describing:

   * What the change does
   * Why it’s useful
   * Any migration or compatibility considerations

Clear, incremental PRs are easier to review and merge.
